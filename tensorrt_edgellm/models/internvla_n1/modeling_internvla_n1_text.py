InternVLA-N1-DualVLN System-2 backbone.

The text decoder is a stock Qwen2.5-VL transformer, so the only thing this adds
is the bridge to System 1.

InternVLA-N1 appends ``n_query`` learned trajectory queries to the prompt and
takes the hidden states at those positions as the entire conditioning signal for
the System-1 diffusion head -- token output is not used for navigation at all.
Those hidden states go through the final norm and a two-layer projector
(``cond_projector``) to become ``z_latents``.

The final norm and ``cond_projector`` are folded into the graph, so the engine
emits ``z_latents`` directly at ``[batch, n_query, latent_dim]``. The learned
``latent_queries`` ride in the embedding table: the export writes them into the
table's trailing padding rows and registers matching special tokens, so a prompt
ending in those tokens puts the queries into the sequence through the runtime's
ordinary embedding lookup -- the same route Alpamayo uses for its trajectory
tokens. No runtime API changes and no host-side projection are needed.

One consequence must be understood by every consumer. The runtime's
hidden-states plumbing sizes and copies its buffer as
``{batch, prefillLen, hiddenSize}`` from config, not from the engine's actual
output shape, so ``getBaseModelHiddenStates`` reports a model-width buffer while
only the first ``n_query * latent_dim`` elements are real. Read that prefix and
ignore the reported shape. The alternative -- keeping the projector on the host
-- was implemented first and reverted by explicit choice: a self-contained
engine was judged worth the prefix-read contract.
