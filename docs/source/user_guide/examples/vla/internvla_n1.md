# InternVLA-N1-DualVLN

InternVLA-N1-DualVLN is a vision-language *navigation* model built from two systems that run at
different rates:

- **System 2** — a Qwen2.5-VL-7B planner. Standard VLM export; served by the core runtime.
- **System 1** — a flow-matching trajectory expert plus a memory block over recent frames.

They are joined by `z_latents`: the hidden states at the model's trajectory-query positions,
normalized and projected. That projection is folded into the LLM graph, so the engine emits
`z_latents` directly and nothing downstream has to carry projector weights or reproduce the
norm ordering.

The trajectory queries themselves are four learned embeddings, and they travel as real tokens:
the export writes them into the embedding table's trailing padding rows and registers
`<|latent_q0|>`..`<|latent_q3|>` as special tokens (the IDs are recorded in the engine's
`config.json` under `latent_query_token_ids`). A prompt that ends with those four tokens puts
the queries into the sequence through the runtime's ordinary embedding lookup — the same route
Alpamayo uses for its trajectory tokens — so no runtime API change is involved. They belong
*after* the assistant generation prompt, which is where the model was trained to find them.

One convention consumers must know: the runtime copies its hidden-states buffer at model width
regardless of the engine's actual output shape, so `getBaseModelHiddenStates` reports
`[1, seq, hidden]` while only the first `n_query * latent_dim` elements are the `z_latents`.
Read that prefix and ignore the reported shape.

The planner's *text* output is not what drives navigation. A checkpoint can produce fluent
replies and still be useless here; `z_latents` is the signal that matters.

## Export

One command produces all three components from the released checkpoint. No repackaging step is
needed — the exporter reads the InternVLA config directly.

```bash
tensorrt-edgellm-export /path/to/InternVLA-N1-DualVLN ./onnx
```

```
onnx/llm/model.onnx        + embedding.safetensors   System 2 decoder, emits z_latents
onnx/visual/model.onnx                               Qwen2.5-VL tower, unchanged
onnx/action/memory.onnx                              DINOv2 + temporal encoder + resampler
onnx/action/traj_dit.onnx                            one flow-matching denoising step
```

The System-1 component ships **two** graphs rather than one. The memory block runs once per
observation window while the trajectory expert runs once per denoising step, so a fused graph
would re-encode the frames on every step.

## Build

System 2 uses the standard executables:

```bash
llm_build    --onnxDir onnx/llm    --engineDir engines/llm \
             --maxBatchSize 1 --maxInputLen 3072 --maxKVCacheCapacity 4096
visual_build --onnxDir onnx/visual --engineDir engines \
             --minImageTokens 4 --maxImageTokens 4096 --maxImageTokensPerImage 1024
```

Size the visual engine for multi-image prompts. A navigation prompt carries roughly ten frames
and about 1764 image tokens; the single-image demo default of 512 cannot hold one.

System 1 builds with `trtexec`, since its two graphs do not share the single-`model.onnx`
layout `action_build` expects:

```bash
trtexec --onnx=onnx/action/traj_dit.onnx --saveEngine=engines/action/traj_dit.engine --bf16 \
        --minShapes=latents:64x32x3,timestep:64,z_latents:64x4x768  \
        --optShapes=latents:64x32x3,timestep:64,z_latents:64x36x768 \
        --maxShapes=latents:64x32x3,timestep:64,z_latents:64x64x768
trtexec --onnx=onnx/action/memory.onnx --saveEngine=engines/action/memory.engine --bf16 \
        --minShapes=images:1x3x224x224 --optShapes=images:2x3x224x224 --maxShapes=images:8x3x224x224
```

The trajectory batch is `2 * num_sample_trajs` because the sampler runs classifier-free
guidance: the conditioning is `[null, real]` and the latents are duplicated.

## Run

Both systems asynchronously in one process — System 2 planning on a background thread while
System 1 keeps sampling from the newest plan:

```bash
internvla_n1_dual_system_inference \
    --llmEngineDir engines/llm --actionEngineDir engines/action \
    --frames frames.bin --noise noise.bin --ticks 40 --cadence 4
```

Guidance defaults to 1.0 in both examples — the value InternNav deploys with; every
`generate_traj` call site in the reference leaves `guidance_scale` at its default. At 1.0 the
classifier-free blend reduces to the conditioned branch, so the null half of the conditioning
costs compute but does not change the output.

One process is not incidental: CUDA orders streams within a context, so System 1's priority
stream only outranks the planner when the two share one. Measured on Thor at `--ticks 40 --cadence 4`,
none of the ticks stalled:

| System 2 | First plan | Control rate |
|---|---|---|
| PyTorch bf16 | 160 ms | 208.1 ms (4.8 Hz) |
| TensorRT FP16 | 144 ms | 66.8 ms (15.0 Hz) |
| TensorRT FP8 | 118 ms | 61.3 ms (16.3 Hz) |
| TensorRT NVFP4 | 100 ms | 55.4 ms (18.0 Hz) |

Quantizing System 2 raises the control rate even though System 1 is BF16 in every row: the
trajectory head costs ~52 ms whichever planner shares the GPU, and what changes is how much the
planner crowds it.

## Driving the resident server from Python

`internvla_n1_dual_system_server` is the same runtime behind a stdin/stdout protocol instead of
one canned run, for a client that steps a simulator or a robot: `internvla_n1_dual_system_inference`
encodes one observation window at startup and ticks, while an agent needs to feed a *new* window
every step. It speaks one JSON object per line, with tensors as raw bytes immediately behind the
header rather than inline in the JSON — see the file's own doc comment for the exact field names.

```bash
internvla_n1_dual_system_server --llmEngineDir engines/llm --actionEngineDir engines/action
```

A minimal client:

```python
import json, subprocess

class Client:
    def __init__(self, llm_dir, action_dir, plugin_path, visual_dir=None):
        argv = ["internvla_n1_dual_system_server",
                "--llmEngineDir", llm_dir, "--actionEngineDir", action_dir]
        if visual_dir:
            argv += ["--multimodalEngineDir", visual_dir]
        self.p = subprocess.Popen(argv, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                                  bufsize=0, env={"EDGELLM_PLUGIN_PATH": plugin_path})
        self._read("ready")

    def _read(self, want):
        while True:
            line = self.p.stdout.readline().decode().strip()
            if not line.startswith("{"):
                continue
            obj = json.loads(line)
            if want in obj or "error" in obj:
                if "error" in obj:
                    raise RuntimeError(obj["error"])
                return obj

    def call(self, header, want, blob=b""):
        self.p.stdin.write((json.dumps(header) + "\n").encode() + blob)
        self.p.stdin.flush()
        out = self._read(want)
        n = out.get(want) if want.endswith("_bytes") else None
        if n:
            buf = b""
            while len(buf) < n:
                buf += self.p.stdout.read(n - len(buf))
            out["_payload"] = buf
        return out
```

One planning step. `raw_text` is the already-templated prompt with the four `<|latent_qN|>`
tokens appended — re-templating it server-side would double the control tokens:

```python
prompt = ("<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n"
          + instruction + "<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n")
latent_tokens = "".join(f"<|latent_q{i}|>" for i in range(4))

c = Client(llm_dir, action_dir, plugin_path)

# First plan of an episode: nothing to steer on yet, so wait for it.
c.call({"request": "replan", "raw_text": prompt + latent_tokens, "wait": True}, "queued")

out = c.call({"request": "trajectory", "images_bytes": len(frames_bytes),
              "noise_bytes": len(noise_bytes), "num_frames": 2},
             "trajectory_bytes", blob=frames_bytes + noise_bytes)
trajectories = np.frombuffer(out["_payload"], dtype=np.float32).reshape(32, 32, 3)
print("plan is", out["staleness"], "observations old")

# Subsequent replans: fire and forget, System 1 keeps running on the last plan.
c.call({"request": "replan", "raw_text": prompt + latent_tokens, "wait": False}, "queued")
```

### Where `frames.bin` / `noise.bin` come from

The `Run` examples above pass raw `numpy.ndarray.tofile()` dumps — `[frames, 3, 224, 224]` and
`[num_trajs, 32, 3]` float32, nothing else in the file. Nothing in this repo generates them;
either draw them for a latency check, or build them from real frames for an actual decision.

**Random, latency/plumbing check only** — the trajectories that come out are meaningless, only
the timing and "did it crash" are real:

```python
import numpy as np
np.random.default_rng(0).standard_normal((2, 3, 224, 224)).astype(np.float32).tofile("frames.bin")
np.random.default_rng(1).standard_normal((32, 32, 3)).astype(np.float32).tofile("noise.bin")
```

**Real frames, for an actual decision.** Must already be normalized with the ResNet statistics
— the memory block does not normalize again, and feeding `[0, 255]` pixels gives plausible-looking
but wrong tokens with no error:

```python
from PIL import Image

MEAN = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406], dtype=np.float32)
STD  = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225], dtype=np.float32)

def frame_to_chw(path):
    img = np.asarray(Image.open(path).resize((224, 224))).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
    return ((img - MEAN) / STD).transpose(2, 0, 1)   # HWC -> CHW

frames = np.stack([frame_to_chw("goal.png"), frame_to_chw("current.png")])
frames.astype(np.float32).tofile("frames.bin")
```

This is the pattern the InternNav habitat-sim harness used to produce the closed-loop SR numbers
in this PR: a thin Python client swaps `model.generate` / `generate_latents` / `generate_traj`
for calls into this server, since habitat-sim has no C++ binding and the evaluator has to stay
Python.

## Notes

**NVFP4 needs a build flag on TRT 10.13.** The CASK epilogue fusion miscompiles NVFP4
at batch 1, and the resulting engine is both wrong and *faster* -- 62.3 ms against 72.8 ms for
the correct one, because a miscompiled kernel does less work. A number that good from an
unpatched build is the symptom, not a win. Export `__LUNOWUD=-cask_fusion:max_num_epilogues=1`
before `llm_build`, or build with `--maxBatchSize 2`, which sidesteps it at no cost.

**System 1 stays BF16.** Quantizing it was measured: FP8 costs about six times the waypoint
deviation to save 0.7 % of deployed weights and 1.7 % of a planning step, because System 2
dominates both.

**Engine I/O is fp32/int64 even though the weights are BF16.** Passing bf16 tensors fails an
assertion rather than converting silently.

**The memory block expects normalized frames.** The reference divides by the ResNet statistics
before this block, and the block does not normalize again. Feeding raw pixels produces
plausible-looking but wrong tokens.

## The two systems run at different rates

System 2 plans in roughly 646 ms; System 1 produces a trajectory in 46 ms. The head is meant
to keep running on the newest plan available rather than waiting for a fresh one, so the
runtime puts the planner on its own thread (`InternVLAN1DualSystemDriver`) and hands plans over
through shared state that publishes atomically.

The planner is injected, not owned: what a plan *is* -- which frames, which prompt, which
engine -- belongs to the deployment. What the runtime guarantees is that a slow planner cannot
stall the trajectory loop.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **Running on a stale plan is normal, not a failure.** `stalenessAt()` reports how many
  observations old the current plan is, so a caller can bound it.
- **Give System 1 a high-priority stream.** It produces the control output, so it is the
  workload that must not be starved; System 2 is allowed to take longer.
  `InternVLAN1System1Runner::makeControlStream()` creates one at the device's greatest
  priority. It works only when System 2 shares the process: priorities order streams within a
  CUDA context, and across processes the GPU time-slices between contexts instead. Measured
  both ways against a competing load — 94.0 ms at equal priority against 73.3 ms with it in the
  same process, and 121 ms either way across processes. Alone it is 48.2 ms, so in-process
  priority recovers about half of what contention costs and nothing recovers the rest, since
  CUDA preempts between kernels rather than inside one.
- **The gain is latency hiding, not parallel throughput.** With System 2 running, the
  trajectory loop drops from 20.7 Hz to 8.2 Hz -- the two contend for the GPU rather than
  overlapping. Asynchrony is still what you want: without it the head stalls completely for the
  ~646 ms System 2 takes, and 8.2 Hz throughout beats zero followed by a burst. The separate
  context pool is a correctness property -- the two cannot corrupt each other's scratch -- not
  a speed one.

## Measured

Jetson Thor, idle GPU, batch 1, measured with `llm_bench`.

### System 2

| Variant | prefill (1024 tokens) | decode (pastKV 1024) | engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| PyTorch bf16 | 328.93 ms | 99.35 ms | ~15 GB |
| TensorRT FP16 | 155.5 ms | 59.0 ms | 13.18 GB |
| TensorRT FP8 | 90.6 ms | 32.8 ms | 7.10 GB |
| TensorRT NVFP4 | 75.4 ms | 20.3 ms | 4.45 GB |

Against PyTorch that is 2.1x/1.7x for FP16, 3.6x/3.0x for FP8 and 4.4x/4.9x for NVFP4. The
PyTorch row runs the same decoder over the same input length and past-KV length as `llm_bench`,
so the rows are comparable; it is not the model's end-to-end agent latency. Run-to-run drift
across sittings is about 4%, the same order as the gap between repeated measurements of one
engine — do not read a winner out of a few milliseconds.

**NVFP4 is the recommendation, and the offline metrics do not show why.** An earlier revision of
this page recommended FP8 and ruled NVFP4 out because its bridge cosine (0.962) sits below a 0.99
gate. Closed-loop success rate over 199 R2R val_unseen episodes contradicts that: NVFP4 reaches
67.8% against PyTorch's 69.8% (McNemar p = 0.572), while FP16 — highest on every cosine — scores
*lowest* of the three at 66.8%. Neither z-cosine nor trajectory cosine predicts navigation
success for this model. Use cosine to catch a broken export (0.25 means broken) and accept on SR.

`llm_bench` measures System 2 only: it links `edgellmCore` and cannot reach
`InternVLAN1System1Runner`, so System-1 and end-to-end numbers come from
`internvla_n1_dual_system_inference` instead.

### System 1

| | |
|---|---|
| trajectory loop, 10 steps x 32 samples | 48.3 ms (20.7 Hz) |
| the same loop with System 2 running | 121.6 ms (8.2 Hz) |
| the same loop in Python | 61.8 ms |
| PyTorch reference | 175.4 ms |
| memory engine / trajectory engine | 109 MB / 72 MB |

With a planner 14x slower than the trajectory loop running concurrently, the loop's worst
single tick grew by under 8 % and replan requests coalesced 15 into 5 — a request arriving
while one is in flight replaces the pending one rather than queueing behind it.

Fidelity against the PyTorch reference, same weights: memory block cosine 0.99993, one
denoising step 0.99996, and the full C++ loop reproduces the Python loop at cosine 1.00000000
(max abs diff 4.5e-07).
