//! \brief InternVLA-N1 System 1: the memory block and the flow-matching trajectory loop.
//!
//! System 2 (a stock Qwen2.5-VL) is served by the core runtime and emits `z_latents` directly,
//! so this runner needs nothing from it but that tensor.
//!
//! Two engines rather than one, deliberately: the memory block runs once per observation window
//! while the trajectory expert runs once per denoising step, so a fused graph would re-encode
//! the frames on every step.
//!
//! Everything the loop does outside the engines is a scheduler lookup and one fused kernel --
//! the projections that used to surround the expert are inside its graph.
//!
//! \note Owns its own execution contexts. It does **not** join the core runtime's shared
//! context-memory pool, which is sized as a max() over components and therefore assumes its
//! members run serialized. Keeping this runner independent is what lets System 1 and System 2
//! overlap.

    //! \brief Create a stream at the greatest priority the device offers.
    //!
    //! System 1 produces the control output. If its rate collapses under a competing load the
    //! trajectories arrive too late to steer with, so it is the workload that must not be
    //! starved -- unlike System 2, which is allowed to take longer.
    //!
    //! **Only effective when System 2 shares this process.** Stream priorities order streams
    //! within one CUDA context; across processes the GPU time-slices between contexts and the
    //! priority is invisible. Measured on Thor both ways, against a competing load:
    //!
    //!   same process    94.0 ms per trajectory at equal priority, 73.3 ms with this stream
    //!   separate process 121 ms either way -- no effect at all
    //!
    //! Alone it is 48.2 ms. So in-process priority recovers roughly half of what contention
    //! costs, and no arrangement recovers all of it: CUDA preempts between kernels, not inside
    //! one. If System 2 runs as its own process, this stream buys nothing and the integration
    //! is what needs fixing, not the priority.
