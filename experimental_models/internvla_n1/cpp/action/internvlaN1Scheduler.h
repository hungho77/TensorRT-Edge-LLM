//! \brief Flow-matching Euler scheduler for the InternVLA-N1 System-1 denoising loop.
//!
//! Ports the diffusers `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler` as the reference drives it:
//! `set_timesteps(N, sigmas=linspace(1.0, 1/N, N))` with the default `shift = 1.0`.
//!
//! Under that configuration the schedule collapses to something exact and closed-form --
//! `sigma_i = 1 - i / N`, with a terminal `sigma_N = 0` appended, and `timestep_i = 1000 *
//! sigma_i`. Every step therefore has the same `dt = -1 / N`. That is worth stating because the
//! general scheduler has a resolution-dependent time shift and a sigma-interpolation path, and
//! neither is reachable here; reproducing them would add code that cannot run and risk drifting
//! from the reference.
//!
//! The update is the plain Euler step on the flow parameterization:
//!
//!     x_{i+1} = x_i + (sigma_{i+1} - sigma_i) * v_i
//!
//! where `v_i` is the model output for step `i`. The scheduler is stateless with respect to the
//! sample: it owns only the schedule, so a single instance can drive several trajectories.
